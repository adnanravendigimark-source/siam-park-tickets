// Requires a DATABASE_URL env var pointing at your Neon connection string
// (Neon dashboard → Connection Details → "Pooled connection" string).
// Set it in .env locally, and in your Vercel project's Settings →
// Environment Variables for production. Until it's set, every read below
// fails soft and falls back to the real starter content baked into /data
// (see lib/data.ts, lib/posts.ts, lib/homepage.ts, lib/legal.ts) — writes
// from /admin will show DB_ERROR_MESSAGE until DATABASE_URL is configured.
